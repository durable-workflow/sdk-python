# Changelog

All notable changes to the `durable-workflow` Python SDK are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] — unreleased

### Added
- Runtime server version compatibility check at worker registration. On
  `Worker.run()`, the SDK now calls `/api/cluster/info` and refuses to
  register against a server whose major version falls outside the set the
  SDK knows how to talk to. This prevents a 0.1.x worker from silently
  attempting to drive a future breaking-release server. (#302)
- `Client.get_cluster_info()` — fetches the server version and declared
  capability manifest from `/api/cluster/info`.
- Avro payload codec support (optional). Install with
  `pip install 'durable-workflow[avro]'` to pull in `apache/avro 1.12`.
  `serializer.encode()`, `serializer.decode()`, and
  `serializer.envelope()` now accept a `codec=` argument, and
  `decode_envelope()` honors the inner codec tag. The Worker decodes
  Avro-coded activity arguments and echoes the inbound codec on its
  `complete_activity_task` result. Wire format is the Durable Workflow
  generic-wrapper (base64 of `0x00` + Avro binary of a `{json: string,
  version: int}` record), byte-compatible with the PHP
  `Workflow\Serializers\Avro` serializer. (#362)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-12

Initial PyPI release. HTTP+JSON worker and client for the Durable
Workflow server, covering workflow authoring, activity execution, signal
and update commands, and the worker protocol over long-poll HTTP.
